Hides selected pages from menus.

== Description ==

Hides selected pages from menus. You can manage this from your admin panel, so you don't need to open template 
codes to add exclude parameter to wp_list_pages function. Essentially it adds exclude parameter to wp_list_pages 
function but it's so easy now. You can manage via admin panel.
